abstract = "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT). While some analysts disvalue the IoT hype, several technology leaders, governments, and researchers are putting serious efforts to develop solutions enabling wide IoT deployment. Thus, the huge amount of generated data, the high network scale, the security and privacy concerns, the new requirements in terms of QoS, and the heterogeneity in this ubiquitous network of networks make its implementation a very challenging task. SDN, a new networking paradigm, has revealed its usefulness in reducing the management complexities in today's networks. Additionally, SDN, having a global view of the network, has presented effective security solutions. On the other hand, fog computing, a new data service platform, consists of pushing the data to the network edge reducing the cost (in terms of bandwidth consumption and high latency) of “big data” transportation through the core network. In this paper, we critically review the SDN and fog computing-based solutions to overcome the IoT main challenges, highlighting their advantages, and exposing their weaknesses. Thus, we make recommendations at the end of this paper for the upcoming research work."
